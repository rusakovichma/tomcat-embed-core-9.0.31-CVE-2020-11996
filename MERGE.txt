Apache Tomcat re-uses code from a number of other Apache projects. There are
several reasons why depending on the binary releases of those projects is not
ideal. These include:
- potential conflicts if a web application ships with the same JAR
- a large JAR where Tomcat only depends on a small fraction


GIT
===

Updates from Git are applied manually via patch files. Patch files are generated
using:
git diff <last SHA1>:<sub-tree> HEAD:<sub-tree> > temp.patch
The most recently merged SHA1 for the component below should be updated after
the patch file has been applied and committed
